# spacexProgramList

This project is for showing all the details of the planet in the galaxy and also user can apply filters to get the particular output.

# Design approcach:-
For showing the two columns in the desktop and mobile view, I have used the following approach:-

a)Taking the whole container to one row and then dividing them into two seprate columns using css-flex.
b)To show the all the filters in the left side , have used proper css flex and styled them.
c)To show all the cards in the right side, which displays all the planet details I have used css-flex properties like display:flex which aligns them in row
and flex-wrap to wrap them in the container.
By using this we can have 3 cards on desktop view and 2 cards on tablet . It sets accrording to the screen size.
